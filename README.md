# Coffee_Analysis
An Analysis of worldwide coffee production and consumption.
## General Information
Though I have been involved in may analysis projects, this project is my first "stand alone" analysis. No tutorials, no solution code, just using what I have been learning through various classes in Data Analysis.

The project invovles:

- Preprocessing the data
- DataFrame creation for analysis
- Data visualization

I hope to answer
- who are the top 5 countries for exporting, importing, and consuming coffee?
- what has the growth been for these countries?
- which country has seen the largest growth?

I am sure there will be additional questions that will arise during the anaylsis.
